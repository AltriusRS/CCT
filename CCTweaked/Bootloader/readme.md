# BootOS

A project which intends to make it easy to update your CC programs by pulling from GitHub and installing dependencies
automagically!

## How it Works

BootOS is installed by CoreOS to manage system updates for any installed software that is present on your CC device.

It uses the power of git to upgrade your installed application of choice whenever updates become available, then
automatically launches the software after updating.
