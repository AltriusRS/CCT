This is my collection of various applications I have written for ComputerCraft, I
use most of them whilst playing various mod packs with my friends, and it is always
nice to just have the programs be easy to install without issue

### Disclaimer

Some of these scripts require the presence of
the [Advanced Peripherals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-peripherals)
mod in order to work.

Also, some scripts contain foul language in error messages, because it makes
them funnier for my friends. Don't judge.
