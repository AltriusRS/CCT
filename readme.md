# CCT

This is my collection of various applications I have written for ComputerCraft, I
use most of them whilst playing various mod packs with my friends, and it is always
nice to just have the programs be easy to install without issue

### Disclaimer

Some of these scripts require the presence of
the [Advanced Peripherals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-peripherals)
mod in order to work.

Also, some scripts contain foul language in error messages, because it makes
them funnier for my friends. Don't judge.

## Current projects

I am currently porting the source code for all of my actively used CC projects to TypeScript using
the [TypeScript-To-Lua](https://typescripttolua.github.io) transpiler project.

My main goal is to work on and improve CoreOS, BootOS, and (currently) StockOS
